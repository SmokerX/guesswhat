# About Me
虚步, a Ph.D. student at BUPT. I am very fortunate to be advised by my advisor who is a great tutor. My research is in the area of Vision and Language with a focus on Visual Dialogue. In particular, I am interested in building a visual conversation agent (social robot) that can see the world and talk with humans in natural language. Other interests include Visual Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Visual Question Generation and Visual Dialog based Referring Expression.

<b>Now I'm doing research on GuessWhich and Visual Dialog(VisDial)</b>, please feel free to concat me with pangweitf@bupt.edu.cn or pangweitf@163.com if you have any questions or concerns.

# GuessWhat?! Game

GuessWhat?! is an object-guessing game between two players. It has attracted great research interest in recent years.

## Performance for GuessWhat?! Game
![My latest performance for GuessWhat?! game](https://github.com/xubuvd/guesswhat/raw/master/GuessWhat_accuracy_Nov2019.png)

As shown in the uploaded figure "guesswhat_performance_2019.png", our latest research progress of GuessWhat?! game, it achieves near-perfect accuracy of 83.3% and outperforms all the previous methods. Notes that the human-level performance is 84.4%.

<b>This research was started in Mar. 2019 and ended in Nov. 2019.</b>

The experimental codes are stilling being refined, coming soon.
