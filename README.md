As shown in the uploaded figure "guesswhat_performance_2019.png", our last research progress of GuessWhat?! game, it achieves near-perfect accuracy of 83.3% and outperforms all the previous methods. This research was ended in Nov. 2019.

Now i'm doing GuessWhich and VisDial, please feel free to concat me with pangweitf@bupt.edu.cn or pangweitf@163.com if you have any questions or concerns.

The experimental code is stilling being refined, coming soon.
